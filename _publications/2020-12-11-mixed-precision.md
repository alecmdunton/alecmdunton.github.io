Renewed interest in mixed-precision algorithms has emerged due to growing data capacity and bandwidth concerns,  as well as the advancement of GPU’s,  which enable significant speedup  for  low  precision  arithmetic.   In  light  of  this,  we  propose  a  mixed-precision  algorithm  to generate a double-precision accurate matrix interpolative decomposition (ID) approximation under a given set of criteria.  Though low precision arithmetic suffers from quicker accumulation of round-off  error,  for  many  data-rich  applications  we  nevertheless  attain  viable  approximation  accuracies, as the error incurred using low precision arithmetic is dominated by the error inherent to low-rank approximation.  We then conduct several simulated numerical tests to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms.  Finally, we present the application of our algorithms to a problem in model reduction for particle-laden turbulent flow.
